# ButtonCodeChall

This Application has two classes. The first class will show the current users and their information.
At the bottom you will be able to add a new user with another set of credentials.

Once on the next activity, you will be able to add user Name, Email and Candidate number.

Once you submit the Candidates information you will be brought back to the main activity and see the new user added and current users.
